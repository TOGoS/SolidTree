- +x+y+z mode for putting levels side-by-side
  so that 8x8x8s can fit more nicely in an 80-column text file

- Control all aspects of scene via forth control script
  - for interactive
  - command to export batch script
  
- Batch scripts are like control scripts but render synchronously

- Both control and batch scripts can initialize all scene variables
  and export as another script.

- RGBE importer/exporter
  can use raw RGBE * w * h as file format; dimensions can be encoded in extension or guessed
  based on context
  
  - Look at Radiance for semantics of R, G, B, E; use if simple enough, otherwise use custom meaning

- Sky boxes
  store as 6-square-image vertical strip
  - export!
  - import!

- Generate hilly terrain (use noise3 library from TMCMG!)

- ability to merge nodes from forth scripts

- Logical script/result separation
  - '<script-id> ctx-get' (in .fs) or <script-id> (in .tsn) evaluates to a Binding( Script, ContextSnapshot )
  - Bindings are lazily converted to nodes when a node is needed
  - Bindings are 'refined' with <binding>( <param>@<value>, ... ) syntax in .tsn
  - Bindings can be rebound to the current context by '<binding> rebind' in .fs
  - This will allow LoadContext.get(...) to be used in place of direct NodeLoader.get(...)
  - <name> = <script-id>( <param-overrides> ) syntax
